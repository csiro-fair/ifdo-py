"""
Define and implement the Image FAIR Digital Object (iFDO) specification for image metadata management.

This module provides a comprehensive set of classes and data structures for representing, storing, and managing
metadata associated with image sets and individual images. It implements the iFDO specification, which aims to
make image data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). The module includes classes for
various aspects of image metadata, such as acquisition details, quality metrics, annotations, and calibration
information.

Imports:
    datetime: Provides classes for working with dates and times.
    enum: Supplies the Enum class for creating enumerated constants.
    pathlib: Offers classes representing filesystem paths with semantics appropriate for different operating systems.
    pydantic: Provides data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.
    stringcase: Offers string case conversion utilities.
    yaml: Implements YAML parser and emitter for Python.
    ifdo.model: Contains the base model implementation for iFDO classes.

Classes:
    ImageData: Represents image data with associated metadata and annotations.
    ImageSetHeader: Represents an image set header with detailed metadata.
    iFDO: Implements the Image FAIR Digital Object specification.
